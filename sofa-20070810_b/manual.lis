                  -------------------------------
                  THE IAU-SOFA SOFTWARE LIBRARIES
                  -------------------------------


  SOFA stands for "Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy".  The SOFA
  software libraries are a collection of subprograms, in source-
  code form, which implement official IAU algorithms for fundamental-
  astronomy computations.   The subprograms at present comprise 109
  "astronomy" routines supported by 52 "vector/matrix" routines, all
  written in Fortran.  In the future the number of astronomy routines
  will increase, and an implementation in C (and perhaps other
  languages) will be introduced.


THE SOFA INITIATIVE

SOFA is an IAU Service which operates under Division 1 (Fundamental
Astronomy) and reports through Commission 19 (Rotation of the Earth).

The IAU set up the SOFA initiative at the 1994 General Assembly, to
promulgate an authoritative set of fundamental-astronomy constants and
algorithms.  At the subsequent General Assembly, in 1997, the
appointment of a SOFA Review Board and the selection of a site for the
SOFA Center (the outlet for SOFA products) were announced.

The SOFA initiative was originally proposed by the IAU Working Group on
Astronomical Standards (WGAS), under the chairmanship of
Toshio Fukushima.  The proposal was for "...new arrangements to
establish and maintain an accessible and authoritative set of constants,
algorithms and procedures that implement standard models used in
fundamental astronomy".  The SOFA Software Libraries implement the
"algorithms" part of the SOFA initiative.  They were developed under the
supervision of an international panel called the SOFA Review Board.  The
current membership of this panel is listed in an appendix.

A feature of the original SOFA software proposals was that the products
would be self-contained and not depend on other software.  This includes
basic documentation, which, like the present file, will mostly be plain
ASCII text.  It should also be noted that there is no assumption that
the software will be used on a particular computer and Operating System.
Although OS-related facilities may be present (Unix make files for
instance, use by the SOFA Center of automatic code management systems,
HTML versions of some documentation), the routines themselves will be
visible as individual text files and will run on a variety of platforms.


ALGORITHMS

The SOFA Review Board's initial goal has been to create a set of
callable subprograms.  Whether "subroutines" or "functions", they are
all referred to simply as "routines".  They are designed for use by
software developers wishing to write complete applications;  no
runnable, free-standing applications are included in SOFA's present
plans.

The algorithms are drawn from a variety of sources.  Because most of the
routines so far developed have either been standard "text-book"
operations or implement well-documented standard algorithms, it has not
been necessary to invite the whole community to submit algorithms,
though consultation with authorities has occurred where necessary.  It
should also be noted that consistency with the conventions published by
the International Earth Rotation Service was a stipulation in the
original SOFA proposals, further constraining the software designs.
This state of affairs will continue to exist for some time, as there is
a large backlog of agreed extensions to work on.  However, in the future
the Board may decide to call for proposals, and is in the meantime
willing to look into any suggestions that are received by the SOFA
Center.


SCOPE

The routines currently available are listed in the next two chapters of
this document.

The "astronomy" library comprises 109 routines (including one obsolete
routine that now appears under a revised name).  The areas addressed
include calendars, time scales, ephemerides, precession-nutation, star
space-motion, and star catalog transformations.

The "vector-matrix" library, comprising 52 routines, contains a
collection of simple tools for manipulating the vectors, matrices and
angles used by the astronomy routines.

There is no explicit commitment by SOFA to support historical models,
though as time goes on a legacy of superseded models will naturally
accumulate.  There is, for example, no support of B1950/FK4 star
coordinates, or pre-1976 precession models, though these capabilities
could be added were there significant demand.

Though the SOFA software libraries are rather limited in scope, and are
likely to remain so for a considerable time, they do offer distinct
advantages to prospective users.  In particular, the routines are:

  * authoritative:  they are IAU-backed and have been constructed with
    great care;

  * practical:  they are straightforward to use in spite of being
    precise and rigorous (to some stated degree);

  * accessible and supported: they are downloadable from an easy-to-
    find place, they are in an integrated and consistent form, they
    come with adequate internal documentation, and help for users is
    available.


VERSIONS

Once it has been published, an issue will not be revised or updated and
will remain accessible indefinitely.  Subsequent issues may, however,
include corrected versions under the original filename and routine name.
However, where a different model is introduced, it will have a different
name.

The issues will be referred to by the date when they were announced.
The frequency of re-issue will be decided by the Board, taking into
account the importance of the changes and the impact on the user
community.


DOCUMENTATION

At present there is little free-standing documentation about individual
routines.  However, each routine has preamble comments which specify in
detail what the routine does and how it is used.

The file sofa_pn.pdf describes the SOFA tools for precession-nutation
and other aspects of Earth attitude and includes example code and (see
the appendix) diagrams showing the interrelationships between the
routines supporting the latest (IAU 2006/2000A) models.


PROGRAMMING STANDARDS

The first releases have been in Fortran 77 only.  Work on C counterparts
is planned, and related software in other languages is under
consideration.

The Fortran code conforms to ANSI X3.9-1978 in all but two minor
respects: each has an IMPLICIT NONE declaration, and its name has a
prefix of "iau_" and may be longer than 6 characters.  A global edit to
erase both of these will produce ANSI-compliant code with no change in
its function.

Fortran coding style, and restrictions on the range of language
features, have been much debated by the Board, and the results comply
with the majority view.  There is (at present) no document that defines
the standard, but the code itself offers a wide range of examples of
what is acceptable.

The routines contain explicit numerical constants (the INCLUDE statement
is not part of ANSI Fortran 77).  These are drawn from the file
consts.lis, which is listed in an appendix.


COPYRIGHT ISSUES

Copyright for all of the SOFA software and documentation is owned by the
IAU SOFA Review Board.  The Software is made available free of charge
for use by private individuals for non-profit research and by non-profit
educational, academic and research institutions.  Potential commercial
users of the Software should contact the Board.

Further details are included in the block of comments which concludes
every routine.  This block of comments is also given as an appendix to
the present document.


ACCURACY

The SOFA policy is to organize the calculations so that the machine
accuracy is fully exploited.  The gap between the precision of the
underlying model or theory and the computational resolution has to be
kept as large as possible, hopefully leaving several orders of
magnitude of headroom.

The SOFA routines in some cases involve design compromises between rigor
and ease of use (and also speed, though nowadays this is seldom a major
concern).


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The Board is indebted to a number of contributors, who are acknowledged
in the preamble comments of the routines concerned.

The Board's effort is provided by the members' individual institutes.

Resources for operating the SOFA Center are provided by Her Majesty's
Nautical Almanac Office, operated by the United Kingdom Hydrographic
Office.  Support for the contributions of the SOFA Review Board chair is
provided by the European Southern Observatory under arrangements with
the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council through its astronomy
programs at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.

                     ----------------------
                     SOFA Astronomy Library
                     ----------------------


PREFACE

The routines described here comprise the SOFA astronomy library.  Their
general appearance and coding style conforms to conventions agreed by
the SOFA Review Board, and their functions, names and algorithms have
been ratified by the Board.  Procedures for soliciting and agreeing
additions to the library are still evolving.

At present the routines are all written in Fortran 77, complying
with the ANSI standard (X3.9-1978) except in two respects:

  (1) All routine names are prefixed with the string "iau_".  If
      necessary, the string can be removed globally;  the result
      is correctly functioning code.

  (2) All routines include an IMPLICIT NONE statement.  This can
      be removed without affecting the behaviour of the code.

If the "iau_" string and/or the IMPLICIT NONE statements are removed
globally, the resulting code is fully ANSI-compliant and is functionally
unaffected.


GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The principal function of the SOFA Astronomy Library is to define
algorithms.  A secondary function is to provide software suitable for
convenient direct use by writers of astronomical applications.

The astronomy routines call on the SOFA vector/matrix library routines,
which are separately listed.

The routines are designed to exploit the full floating-point accuracy
of the machines on which they run, and not to rely on compiler
optimizations.  Within these constraints, the intention is that the code
corresponds to the published formulation (if any).

Dates are always Julian Dates (except in calendar conversion routines)
and are expressed as two double precision numbers which sum to the
required value.

A distinction is made between routines that implement IAU-approved
models and those that use those models to create other results.  The
former are referred to as "canonical models" in the preamble comments;
the latter are described as "support routines".

Using the library requires knowledge of positional astronomy and
time-scales.  These topics are covered in "Explanatory Supplement to the
Astronomical Almanac", P. Kenneth Seidelmann (ed.), University Science
Books, 1992.  Recent developments are documented in the journals, and
references to the relevant papers are given in the SOFA code as
required.  The IERS Conventions are also an essential reference.  The
routines concerned with Earth attitude (precession-nutation etc.) are
described in the SOFA document sofa_pn.pdf.

                   --------------------------
                   SOFA Vector/Matrix Library
                   --------------------------

PREFACE

The routines described here comprise the SOFA vector/matrix library.
Their general appearance and coding style conforms to conventions
agreed by the SOFA Review Board, and their functions, names and
algorithms have been ratified by the Board.  Procedures for
soliciting and agreeing additions to the library are still evolving.

At present the routines are all written in Fortran 77, complying with
the ANSI standard (X3.9-1978) except in two respects:

  (1) All routine names are prefixed with the string "iau_".  If
      necessary, the string can be removed globally;  the result
      is correctly functioning code.

  (2) All routines include an IMPLICIT NONE statement.  This can
      be removed without affecting the behaviour of the code.

If the "iau_" string and/or the IMPLICIT NONE statements are removed
globally, the resulting code is fully ANSI-compliant and is functionally
unaffected.


GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The library consists mostly of routines which operate on ordinary
Cartesian vectors (x,y,z) and 3x3 rotation matrices.  However, there is
also support for vectors which represent velocity as well as position
and vectors which represent rotation instead of position.  The vectors
which represent both position and velocity may be considered still to
have dimensions (3), but to comprise elements each of which is two
numbers, representing the value itself and the time derivative.  Thus:

* "Position" or "p" vectors (or just plain 3-vectors) have dimension
  (3) in Fortran and [3] in C.

* "Position/velocity" or "pv" vectors have dimensions (3,2) in Fortran
  and [2][3] in C.

* "Rotation" or "r" matrices have dimensions (3,3) in Fortran and [3][3]
  in C.  When used for rotation, they are "orthogonal";  the inverse of
  such a matrix is equal to the transpose.  Most of the routines in
  this library do not assume that r-matrices are necessarily orthogonal
  and in fact work on any 3x3 matrix.

* "Rotation" or "r" vectors have dimensions (3) in Fortran and [3] in C.
  Such vectors are a combination of the Euler axis and angle and are
  convertible to and from r-matrices.  The direction is the axis of
  rotation and the magnitude is the angle of rotation, in radians.
  Because the amount of rotation can be scaled up and down simply by
  multiplying the vector by a scalar, r-vectors are useful for
  representing spins about an axis which is fixed.

* The above rules mean that in terms of memory address, the three
  velocity components of a pv-vector follow the three position
  components.  Application code is permitted to exploit this and all
  other knowledge of the internal layouts:  that x, y and z appear in
  that order and are in a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system etc.
  For example, the cp function (copy a p-vector) can be used to copy
  the velocity component of a pv-vector (indeed, this is how the
  CPV routine is coded).

* The routines provided do not completely fill the range of operations
  that link all the various vector and matrix options, but are confined
  to functions that are required by other parts of the SOFA software or
  which are likely to prove useful.

In addition to the vector/matrix routines, the library contains some
routines related to spherical angles, including conversions to and
from sexagesimal format.

Using the library requires knowledge of vector/matrix methods, spherical
trigonometry, and methods of attitude representation.  These topics are
covered in many textbooks, including "Spacecraft Attitude Determination
and Control", James R. Wertz (ed.), Astrophysics and Space Science
Library, Vol. 73, D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1986.

*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  vector/matrix support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     NDP       i        resolution (Note 1)
*     ANGLE     d        angle in radians
*

*  Called:
*     iau_D2TF     decompose days to hms
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) NDP is interpreted as follows:
*
*     NDP         resolution
*      :      ...0000 00 00
*     -7         1000 00 00

*      :            0 00 00.000...
*
*  2) The largest positive useful value for NDP is determined by the
*     size of ANGLE, the format of DOUBLE PRECISION floating-point
*     numbers on the target platform, and the risk of overflowing
*     IDMSF(4).  On a typical platform, for ANGLE up to 2pi, the
*     available floating-point precision might correspond to NDP=12.
*     However, the practical limit is typically NDP=9, set by the
*     capacity of a 32-bit IDMSF(4).

*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's

*     NDP       i        resolution (Note 1)

*     IHMSF     i(4)     hours, minutes, seconds, fraction
*
*  Called:
*     iau_D2TF     decompose days to hms
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) NDP is interpreted as follows:
*
*     NDP         resolution
*      :      ...0000 00 00
*     -7         1000 00 00
*     -6          100 00 00
*     -5           10 00 00
*     -4            1 00 00

*      :            0 00 00.000...
*
*  2) The largest useful value for NDP is determined by the size
*     of ANGLE, the format of DOUBLE PRECISION floating-point numbers
*     on the target platform, and the risk of overflowing IHMSF(4).
*     On a typical platform, for ANGLE up to 2pi, the available
*     floating-point precision might correspond to NDP=12.  However,
*     the practical limit is typically NDP=9, set by the capacity of
*     a 32-bit IHMSF(4).
*
*  3) The absolute value of ANGLE may exceed 2pi.  In cases where it
*     does not, it is up to the caller to test for and handle the
*     case where ANGLE is very nearly 2pi and rounds up to 24 hours,
*     by testing for IHMSF(1)=24 and setting IHMSF(1-4) to zero.

*     DRA            d   the ICRS RA of the J2000 mean equinox
*
*  Notes
*
*  1) The frame bias corrections in longitude and obliquity (radians)
*     are required in order to correct for the offset between the GCRS
*     pole and the mean J2000 pole.  They define, with respect to the
*     GCRS frame, a J2000 mean pole that is consistent with the rest of
*     the IAU 2000A precession-nutation model.
*
*  2) In addition to the displacement of the pole, the complete
*     description of the frame bias requires also an offset in right
*     ascension.  This is not part of the IAU 2000A model, and is from
*     Chapront et al. (2002).  It is returned in radians.
*
*  3) This is a supplemented implementation of one aspect of the IAU
*     2000A nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly
*     in 2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002).

*  Notes:
*
*  1) The name of the present routine, iau_C2TCEO, reflects the original
*     name of the celestial intermediate origin (CIO), which before the
*     adoption of IAU 2006 Resolution 2 was called the "celestial
*     ephemeris origin" (CEO).
*
*  2) When the name change from CEO to CIO occurred, a new SOFA routine
*     called iau_C2TCIO was introduced as the successor to the existing
*     iau_C2TCEO.  The present routine is merely a front end to the new
*     one.

*     applications.

*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     TTA,TTB     d       TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)

*
*  Returned:
*     RC2T      d(3,3)    celestial-to-terrestrial matrix (Note 4)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT and UT1 dates TTA+TTB and UTA+UTB are Julian Dates,
*     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments UTA and
*     UTB.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of
*     these ways, among others:
*
*             UTA            UTB
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
*     between resolution and convenience.  In the case of UTA,UTB, the
*     date & time method is best matched to the Earth rotation angle
*     algorithm used:  maximum accuracy (or, at least, minimum noise) is
*     delivered when the UTA argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
*     question and the UTB argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
*     versa.
*
*  2) The caller is responsible for providing the nutation components;
*     they are in longitude and obliquity, in radians and are with
*     respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  For high-accuracy
*     applications, free core nutation should be included as well as
*     any other relevant corrections to the position of the CIP.
*
*  3) XP and YP are the "coordinates of the pole", in radians, which
*     position the Celestial Intermediate Pole in the International
*     Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003).  In a
*     geocentric right-handed triad u,v,w, where the w-axis points at
*     the north geographic pole, the v-axis points towards the origin
*     of longitudes and the u axis completes the system, XP = +u and
*     YP = -v.
*
*  4) The matrix RC2T transforms from celestial to terrestrial
*     coordinates:
*
*        [TRS]  =  RPOM * R_3(GST) * RBPN * [CRS]
*
*               =  RC2T * [CRS]
*
*     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
*     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
*     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), RBPN is the
*     bias-precession-nutation matrix, GST is the Greenwich (apparent)
*     Sidereal Time and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.

*      :            0 00 00.000...
*
*  2) The largest positive useful value for NDP is determined by the
*     size of DAYS, the format of DOUBLE PRECISION floating-point
*     numbers on the target platform, and the risk of overflowing

*  3) The absolute value of DAYS may exceed 1D0.  In cases where it
*     does not, it is up to the caller to test for and handle the

*                       1 = dubious year (Note 1)

*                      -4 = bad fraction (Note 4)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) UTC began at 1960 January 1.0 (JD 2436934.5) and it is improper
*     to call the routine with an earlier epoch.  If this is attempted,
*     zero is returned together with a warning status.
*
*     Because leap seconds cannot, in principle, be predicted in
*     advance, a reliable check for dates beyond the valid range is
*     impossible.  To guard against gross errors, a year five or more
*     after the release year of the present routine (see parameter IYV)
*     is considered dubious.  In this case a warning status is returned
*     but the result is computed in the normal way.
*
*     For both too-early and too-late years, the warning status is J=+1.
*     This is distinct from the error status J=-1, which signifies a
*     year so early that JD could not be computed.
*
*  2) If the specified date is for a day which ends with a leap second,
*     the UTC-TAI value returned is for the period leading up to the
*     leap second.  If the date is for a day which begins as a leap
*     second ends, the UTC-TAI returned is for the period following the
*     leap second.
*
*  3) The day number must be in the normal calendar range, for example
*     1 through 30 for April.  The "almanac" convention of allowing
*     such dates as January 0 and December 32 is not supported in this
*     routine, in order to avoid confusion near leap seconds.
*
*  4) The fraction of day is used only for dates before the introduction
*     of leap seconds, the first of which occurred at the end of 1971.
*     It is tested for validity (zero to less than 1 is the valid range)
*     even if not used;  if invalid, zero is used and status J=-4 is
*     returned.  For many applications, setting FD to zero is
*     acceptable;  the resulting error is always less than 3 ms (and
*     occurs only pre-1972).
*
*  5) The status value returned in the case where there are multiple
*     errors refers to the first error detected.  For example, if the
*     month and day are 13 and 32 respectively, JSTAT=-2 (bad month)
*     will be returned.
*
*  6) In cases where a valid result is not available, zero is returned.

*
*  Returned:
*    iau_DTDB         d    TDB-TT (seconds)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the arguments DATE1 and DATE2.  For
*     example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these
*     ways, among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
*     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
*     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
*     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
*     good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*     Although the epoch is, formally, barycentric dynamical time (TDB),
*     the terrestrial dynamical time (TT) can be used with no practical
*     effect on the accuracy of the prediction.
*
*  2) TT can be regarded as a coordinate time that is realized as an
*     offset of 32.184s from International Atomic Time,  TAI.  TT is a
*     specific linear transformation of geocentric coordinate time TCG,
*     which is the time scale for the Geocentric Celestial Reference
*     System, GCRS.
*
*  3) TDB is a coordinate time, and is a specific linear transformation
*     of barycentric coordinate time TCB, which is the time scale for
*     the Barycentric Celestial Reference System, BCRS.
*
*  4) The difference TCG-TCB depends on the masses and positions of the
*     bodies of the solar system and the velocity of the Earth.  It is
*     dominated by a rate difference, the residual being of a periodic
*     character.  The latter, which is modeled by the present routine,
*     comprises a main (annual) sinusoidal term of amplitude
*     approximately 0.00166 seconds, plus planetary terms up to about
*     20 microseconds, and lunar and diurnal terms up to 2 microseconds.
*     These effects come from the changing transverse Doppler effect
*     and gravitational red-shift as the observer (on the Earth's
*     surface) experiences variations in speed (with respect to the
*     BCRS) and gravitational potential.
*
*  5) TDB can be regarded as the same as TCB but with a rate adjustment
*     to keep it close to TT, which is convenient for many applications.
*     The history of successive attempts to define TDB is set out in
*     Resolution 3 adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2006, which
*     defines a fixed TDB(TCB) transformation that is consistent with
*     contemporary solar-system ephemerides.  Future ephemerides will
*     imply slightly changed transformations between TCG and TCB, which
*     could introduce a linear drift between TDB and TT;  however, any
*     such drift is unlikely to exceed 1 nanosecond per century.
*
*  6) The geocentric TDB-TT model used in the present routine is that of
*     Fairhead & Bretagnon (1990), in its full form.  It was originally
*     supplied by Fairhead (private communications with P.T.Wallace,
*     1990) as a Fortran subroutine.  The present routine contains an
*     adaptation of the Fairhead code.  The numerical results are
*     essentially unaffected by the changes, the differences with
*     respect to the Fairhead & Bretagnon original being at the 1D-20 s
*     level.
*
*     The topocentric part of the model is from Moyer (1981) and
*     Murray (1983), with fundamental arguments adapted from
*     Simon et al. 1994.  It is an approximation to the expression
*     ( v / c ) . ( r / c ), where v is the barycentric velocity of
*     the Earth, r is the geocentric position of the observer and
*     c is the speed of light.
*
*     By supplying zeroes for U and V, the topocentric part of the
*     model can be nullified, and the routine will return the Fairhead
*     & Bretagnon result alone.
*
*  7) During the interval 1950-2050, the absolute accuracy is better
*     than +/- 3 nanoseconds relative to time ephemerides obtained by
*     direct numerical integrations based on the JPL DE405 solar system
*     ephemeris.
*
*  8) It must be stressed that the present routine is merely a model,
*     and that numerical integration of solar-system ephemerides is the
*     definitive method for predicting the relationship between TCG and
*     TCB and hence between TT and TDB.

*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The "complementary terms" are part of the equation of the
*     equinoxes (EE), classically the difference between apparent and
*     mean Sidereal Time:
*
*        GAST = GMST + EE
*
*     with:
*
*        EE = dpsi * cos(eps)
*
*     where dpsi is the nutation in longitude and eps is the obliquity
*     of date.  However, if the rotation of the Earth were constant in
*     an inertial frame the classical formulation would lead to apparent
*     irregularities in the UT1 timescale traceable to side-effects of
*     precession-nutation.  In order to eliminate these effects from
*     UT1, "complementary terms" were introduced in 1994 (IAU, 1994) and
*     took effect from 1997 (Capitaine and Gontier, 1993):
*
*        GAST = GMST + CT + EE
*
*     By convention, the complementary terms are included as part of the
*     equation of the equinoxes rather than as part of the mean Sidereal
*     Time.  This slightly compromises the "geometrical" interpretation
*     of mean sidereal time but is otherwise inconsequential.
*
*     The present routine computes CT in the above expression,
*     compatible with IAU 2000 resolutions (Capitaine et al., 2002, and
*     IERS Conventions 2003).

*  Notes:
*
*  1) The epoch EPOCH1+EPOCH2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in
*     any convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

*
*              EPOCH1        EPOCH2

*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in

*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*     However, the accuracy of the result is more likely to be
*     limited by the algorithm itself than the way the epoch has been
*     expressed.
*
*  2) On return, the arrays PVH and PVB contain the following:

*
*     The vectors are with respect to the International Celestial
*     Reference Frame.  The time unit is one day in TDB.
*
*  3) The routine is a SIMPLIFIED SOLUTION from the planetary theory
*     VSOP2000 (X. Moisson, P. Bretagnon, 2001, Celes. Mechanics &
*     Dyn. Astron., 80, 3/4, 205-213) and is an adaptation of original
*     Fortran code supplied by P. Bretagnon (private comm., 2000).
*
*  4) Comparisons over the time span 1900-2100 with this simplified
*     solution and the JPL DE405 ephemeris give the following results:

*
*  Earth rotation angle (IAU 2000 model).
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  canonical model.
*
*  Given:
*     DJ1,DJ2     d      UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (see note)
*
*  The result is the Earth rotation angle (radians), in the range 0 to
*  2pi.
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The UT1 date DJ1+DJ2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the arguments DJ1 and DJ2.  For example,
*     JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*             DJ1            DJ2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
*     between resolution and convenience.  The date & time method is
*     best matched to the algorithm used:  maximum accuracy (or, at
*     least, minimum noise) is delivered when the DJ1 argument is for
*     0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the DJ2 argument lies in the
*     range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
*
*  2) The algorithm is adapted from Expression 22 of Capitaine et al.
*     2000.  The time argument has been expressed in days directly,
*     and, to retain precision, integer contributions have been
*     eliminated.  The same formulation is given in IERS Conventions
*     (2003), Chap. 5, Eq. 14.

*
*  Transform an FK5 (J2000) star position into the system of the
*  Hipparcos catalogue, assuming zero Hipparcos proper motion.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     R5              d      FK5 RA (radians), equinox J2000, at date
*     D5              d      FK5 Dec (radians), equinox J2000, at date

*  Returned:

*     DH              d      Hipparcos Dec (radians)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) This routine converts a star position from the FK5 system to
*     the Hipparcos system, in such a way that the Hipparcos proper
*     motion is zero.  Because such a star has, in general, a non-zero
*     proper motion in the FK5 system, the routine requires the date
*     at which the position in the FK5 system was determined.
*
*  2) The date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  3) The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation is modeled as a pure
*     rotation and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalogue are
*     not taken into account.
*
*  4) It was the intention that Hipparcos should be a close
*     approximation to an inertial frame, so that distant objects
*     have zero proper motion;  such objects have (in general)
*     non-zero proper motion in FK5, and this routine returns those
*     fictitious proper motions.
*
*  5) The position returned by this routine is in the FK5 J2000
*     reference system but at date DATE1+DATE2.

*
*  Status:  canonical model.
*
*  Given:
*     UTA, UTB     d      UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
*     TTA, TTB     d      TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
*
*  The result is the Greenwich Apparent Sidereal Time (radians), in the
*  range 0 to 2pi.
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The UT1 and TT dates UTA+UTB and TTA+TTB respectively, are both
*     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the
*     argument pairs.  For example, JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in
*     any of these ways, among others:
*
*            Part A         Part B
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable (in the case of UT;  the TT is not at all critical
*     in this respect).  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
*     between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
*     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
*     Rotation Angle routine, called internally:  maximum accuracy (or,
*     at least, minimum noise) is delivered when the UTA argument is for
*     0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the UTB argument lies in the
*     range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
*
*  2) Both UT1 and TT are required, UT1 to predict the Earth rotation
*     and TT to predict the effects of precession-nutation.  If UT1 is
*     used for both purposes, errors of order 100 microarcseconds
*     result.
*
*  3) This GAST is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions and must be
*     used only in conjunction with other IAU 2000 compatible components

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.
*
*  3) The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation is modeled as a pure
*     rotation and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalogue are
*     not taken into account.
*
*  4) It was the intention that Hipparcos should be a close
*     approximation to an inertial frame, so that distant objects
*     have zero proper motion;  such objects have (in general)
*     non-zero proper motion in FK5, and this routine returns those
*     fictitious proper motions.
*
*  5) The position returned by this routine is in the FK5 J2000

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any

*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The nutation components in longitude and obliquity are in radians
*     and with respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  The
*     obliquity at J2000 is assumed to be the Lieske et al. (1977) value
*     of 84381.448 arcsec.
*
*     Both the luni-solar and planetary nutations are included.  The
*     latter are due to direct planetary nutations and the perturbations
*     of the lunar and terrestrial orbits.
*
*  3) The routine computes the MHB2000 nutation series with the
*     associated corrections for planetary nutations.  It is an
*     implementation of the nutation part of the IAU 2000A precession-
*     nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in
*     2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002), but with the free core
*     nutation (FCN - see Note 4) omitted.
*
*  4) The full MHB2000 model also contains contributions to the
*     nutations in longitude and obliquity due to the free-excitation of
*     the free-core-nutation during the period 1979-2000.  These FCN
*     terms, which are time-dependent and unpredictable, are NOT
*     included in the present routine and, if required, must be
*     independently computed.  With the FCN corrections included, the
*     present routine delivers a pole which is at current epochs
*     accurate to a few hundred microarcseconds.  The omission of FCN
*     introduces further errors of about that size.
*
*  5) The present routine provides classical nutation.  The MHB2000
*     algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also with (i) the
*     offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the adjustments
*     in longitude and obliquity due to the changed precession rates.
*     These additional functions, namely frame bias and precession
*     adjustments, are supported by the SOFA routines iau_BI00 and
*     iau_PR00.
*
*  6) The MHB2000 algorithm also provides "total" nutations, comprising
*     the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession adjustments,
*     luni-solar nutation and planetary nutation.  These total nutations
*     can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976 precession
*     implementation, such as iau_PMAT76, to deliver GCRS-to-true
*     predictions of sub-mas accuracy at current epochs.  However, there
*     are three shortcomings in the MHB2000 model that must be taken
*     into account if more accurate or definitive results are required
*     (see Wallace 2002):
*
*       (i) The MHB2000 total nutations are simply arithmetic sums,
*           yet in reality the various components are successive Euler
*           rotations.  This slight lack of rigor leads to cross terms
*           that exceed 1 mas after a century.  The rigorous procedure
*           is to form the GCRS-to-true rotation matrix by applying the
*           bias, precession and nutation in that order.
*
*      (ii) Although the precession adjustments are stated to be with
*           respect to Lieske et al. (1977), the MHB2000 model does
*           not specify which set of Euler angles are to be used and
*           how the adjustments are to be applied.  The most literal and
*           straightforward procedure is to adopt the 4-rotation
*           epsilon_0, psi_A, omega_A, xi_A option, and to add DPSIPR to
*           psi_A and DEPSPR to both omega_A and eps_A.
*
*     (iii) The MHB2000 model predates the determination by Chapront
*           et al. (2002) of a 14.6 mas displacement between the J2000
*           mean equinox and the origin of the ICRS frame.  It should,
*           however, be noted that neglecting this displacement when
*           calculating star coordinates does not lead to a 14.6 mas
*           change in right ascension, only a small second-order
*           distortion in the pattern of the precession-nutation effect.
*
*     For these reasons, the SOFA routines do not generate the "total
*     nutations" directly, though they can of course easily be generated
*     by calling iau_BI00, iau_PR00 and the present routine and adding
*     the results.

*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  canonical model.
*

*     DATE1,DATE2   d   TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     DPSI,DEPS     d   nutation, luni-solar + planetary (Note 2)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
*     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
*     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
*     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
*     good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The nutation components in longitude and obliquity are in radians
*     and with respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  The
*     obliquity at J2000 is assumed to be the Lieske et al. (1977) value
*     of 84381.448 arcsec.  (The errors that result from using this
*     routine with the IAU 2006 value of 84381.406 arcsec can be
*     neglected.)
*
*     The nutation model consists only of luni-solar terms, but includes
*     also a fixed offset which compensates for certain long-period
*     planetary terms (Note 7).
*
*  3) This routine is an implementation of the IAU 2000B abridged
*     nutation model formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in
*     2000.  The routine computes the MHB_2000_SHORT luni-solar nutation
*     series (Luzum 2001), but without the associated corrections for
*     the precession rate adjustments and the offset between the GCRS
*     and J2000 mean poles.
*
*  4) The full IAU 2000A (MHB2000) nutation model contains nearly 1400
*     terms.  The IAU 2000B model (McCarthy & Luzum 2003) contains only
*     77 terms, plus additional simplifications, yet still delivers
*     results of 1 mas accuracy at present epochs.  This combination of
*     accuracy and size makes the IAU 2000B abridged nutation model
*     suitable for most practical applications.
*
*     The routine delivers a pole accurate to 1 mas from 1900 to 2100
*     (usually better than 1 mas, very occasionally just outside 1 mas).
*     The full IAU 2000A model, which is implemented in the routine
*     iau_NUT00A (q.v.), delivers considerably greater accuracy at
*     current epochs;  however, to realize this improved accuracy,
*     corrections for the essentially unpredictable free-core-nutation
*     (FCN) must also be included.
*
*  5) The present routine provides classical nutation.  The
*     MHB_2000_SHORT algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also
*     with (i) the offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the
*     adjustments in longitude and obliquity due to the changed
*     precession rates.  These additional functions, namely frame bias
*     and precession adjustments, are supported by the SOFA routines
*     iau_BI00 and iau_PR00.
*
*  6) The MHB_2000_SHORT algorithm also provides "total" nutations,
*     comprising the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession
*     adjustments, and nutation (luni-solar + planetary).  These total
*     nutations can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976
*     precession implementation, such as iau_PMAT76, to deliver GCRS-to-
*     true predictions of mas accuracy at current epochs.  However, for
*     symmetry with the iau_NUT00A routine (q.v. for the reasons), the
*     SOFA routines do not generate the "total nutations" directly.
*     Should they be required, they could of course easily be generated
*     by calling iau_BI00, iau_PR00 and the present routine and adding
*     the results.
*
*  7) The IAU 2000B model includes "planetary bias" terms that are fixed
*     in size but compensate for long-period nutations.  The amplitudes
*     quoted in McCarthy & Luzum (2003), namely Dpsi = -1.5835 mas and
*     Depsilon = +1.6339 mas, are optimized for the "total nutations"
*     method described in Note 6.  The Luzum (2001) values used in this
*     SOFA implementation, namely -0.135 mas and +0.388 mas, are
*     optimized for the "rigorous" method, where frame bias, precession
*     and nutation are applied separately and in that order.  During the
*     interval 1995-2050, the SOFA implementation delivers a maximum
*     error of 1.001 mas (not including FCN).

*     Capitaine et al. "P03" precession theory, adopted by the IAU in
*     2006.  The angles are set out in Table 1 of Hilton et al. (2006):
*
*      EPS0   epsilon_0   obliquity at J2000
*      PSIA   psi_A       luni-solar precession
*      OMA    omega_A     inclination of equator wrt J2000 ecliptic
*      BPA    P_A         ecliptic pole x, J2000 ecliptic triad
*      BQA    Q_A         ecliptic pole -y, J2000 ecliptic triad
*      PIA    pi_A        angle between moving and J2000 ecliptics
*      BPIA   Pi_A        longitude of ascending node of the ecliptic
*      EPSA   epsilon_A   obliquity of the ecliptic
*      CHIA   chi_A       planetary precession
*      ZA     z_A         equatorial precession: -3rd 323 Euler angle
*      ZETAA  zeta_A      equatorial precession: -1st 323 Euler angle
*      THETAA theta_A     equatorial precession: 2nd 323 Euler angle
*      PA     p_A         general precession
*      GAM    gamma_J2000 J2000 RA difference of ecliptic poles
*      PHI    phi_J2000   J2000 codeclination of ecliptic pole
*      PSI    psi_J2000   longitude difference of equator poles, J2000
*
*     The returned values are all radians.
*
*  3) Hilton et al. (2006) Table 1 also contains angles that depend on
*     models distinct from the P03 precession theory itself, namely the
*     IAU 2000A frame bias and nutation.  The quoted polynomials are
*     used in other SOFA routines:
*
*     . iau_XY06 contains the polynomial parts of the X and Y series.
*
*     . iau_S06 contains the polynomial part of the s+XY/2 series.
*
*     . iau_PFW06 implements the series for the Fukushima-Williams
*       angles that are with respect to the GCRS pole (i.e. the variants
*       that include frame bias).
*
*  4) The IAU resolution stipulated that the choice of parameterization
*     was left to the user, and so an IAU compliant precession
*     implementation can be constructed using various combinations of
*     the angles returned by the present routine.
*
*  5) The parameterization used by SOFA is the Fukushima-Williams angles
*     referred directly to the GCRS pole.  These are the final four
*     arguments returned by the present routine, but are more
*     efficiently calculated by calling the routine iau_PFW06.  SOFA
*     also supports the direct computation of the CIP GCRS X,Y by
*     series, available by calling iau_XY06.
*
*  6) The agreement between the different parameterizations is at the
*     1 microarcsecond level in the present era.
*
*  7) When constructing a precession formulation that refers to the GCRS
*     pole rather than the dynamical pole, it may (depending on the
*     choice of angles) be necessary to introduce the frame bias
*     explicitly.

*
*  This routine forms three Euler angles which implement general
*  precession from epoch J2000.0, using the IAU 2006 model.  Frame
*  bias (the offset between ICRS and mean J2000.0) is included.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*

*
*  Returned:

*     BZ            d    3rd rotation: radians clockwise around z
*     BTHETA        d    2nd rotation: radians counterclockwise around y
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the arguments DATE1 and DATE2.  For
*     example, JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these
*     ways, among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The traditional accumulated precession angles zeta_A, z_A, theta_A
*     cannot be obtained in the usual way, namely through polynomial
*     expressions, because of the frame bias.  The latter means that two
*     of the angles undergo rapid changes near this date.  They are
*     instead the results of decomposing the precession-bias matrix
*     obtained by using the Fukushima-Williams method, which does not
*     suffer from the problem.  The decomposition returns values which
*     can be used in the conventional formulation and which include
*     frame bias.
*
*  3) The three angles are returned in the conventional order, which
*     is not the same as the order of the corresponding Euler rotations.
*     The precession-bias matrix is R_3(-z) x R_2(+theta) x R_3(-zeta).
*
*  4) Should zeta_A, z_A, theta_A angles be required that do not contain
*     frame bias, they are available by calling the SOFA routine
*     iau_P06E.

*  6) The present SOFA re-implementation of the original Simon et al.
*     Fortran code differs from the original in the following respects:
*
*       *  The date is supplied in two parts.
*
*       *  The result is returned only in equatorial Cartesian form;
*          the ecliptic longitude, latitude and radius vector are not
*          returned.
*
*       *  The result is in the J2000 equatorial frame, not ecliptic.
*
*       *  More is done in-line:  there are fewer calls to other
*          routines.
*
*       *  Different error/warning status values are used.
*
*       *  A different Kepler's-equation-solver is used (avoiding
*          use of COMPLEX*16).
*
*       *  Polynomials in T are nested to minimize rounding errors.
*
*       *  Explicit double-precision constants are used to avoid
*          mixed-mode expressions.
*
*       *  There are other, cosmetic, changes to comply with SOFA
*          style conventions.
*
*     None of the above changes affects the result significantly.
*
*  7) The returned status, J, indicates the most serious condition
*     encountered during execution of the routine.  Illegal NP is
*     considered the most serious, overriding failure to converge,
*     which in turn takes precedence over the remote epoch warning.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The nutation components (luni-solar + planetary, IAU 2000B) in
*     longitude and obliquity are in radians and with respect to the
*     equinox and ecliptic of date.  For more accurate results, but
*     at the cost of increased computation, use the iau_PN00A routine.
*     For the utmost accuracy, use the iau_PN00 routine, where the
*     nutation components are caller-specified.
*
*  3) The mean obliquity is consistent with the IAU 2000 precession.
*
*  4) The matrix RB transforms vectors from GCRS to J2000 mean equator
*     and equinox by applying frame bias.
*
*  5) The matrix RP transforms vectors from J2000 mean equator and
*     equinox to mean equator and equinox of date by applying
*     precession.
*
*  6) The matrix RBP transforms vectors from GCRS to mean equator and
*     equinox of date by applying frame bias then precession.  It is the
*     product RP x RB.
*
*  7) The matrix RN transforms vectors from mean equator and equinox of
*     date to true equator and equinox of date by applying the nutation
*     (luni-solar + planetary).
*
*  8) The matrix RBPN transforms vectors from GCRS to true equator and
*     equinox of date.  It is the product RN x RBP, applying frame bias,
*     precession and nutation in that order.
*
*  9) The X,Y,Z coordinates of the IAU 2000B Celestial Intermediate Pole
*     are elements (3,1-3) of the matrix RBPN.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The matrix operates in the sense V(date) = RMATPN * V(J2000),
*     where the p-vector V(date) is with respect to the true
*     equatorial triad of date DATE1+DATE2 and the p-vector
*     V(J2000) is with respect to the mean equatorial triad of
*     epoch J2000.

*
*  Returned:
*     RPOM     d(3,3)   polar-motion matrix (Note 3)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) XP and YP are the "coordinates of the pole", in radians, which
*     position the Celestial Intermediate Pole in the International
*     Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003).  In a
*     geocentric right-handed triad u,v,w, where the w-axis points at
*     the north geographic pole, the v-axis points towards the origin
*     of longitudes and the u axis completes the system, XP = +u and
*     YP = -v.
*
*  2) SP is the TIO locator s', in radians, which positions the
*     Terrestrial Intermediate Origin on the equator.  It is obtained
*     from polar motion observations by numerical integration, and so is
*     in essence unpredictable.  However, it is dominated by a secular
*     drift of about 47 microarcseconds per century, and so can be taken
*     into account by using s' = -47*t, where t is centuries since
*     J2000.  The routine iau_SP00 implements this approximation.
*
*  3) The matrix operates in the sense V(TRS) = RPOM * V(CIP), meaning
*     that it is the final rotation when computing the pointing
*     direction to a celestial source.

*
*  Notes
*
*  1) The T date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

*
*            DATE1          DATE2

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The precession adjustments are expressed as "nutation components",
*     corrections in longitude and obliquity with respect to the J2000
*     equinox and ecliptic.
*
*  3) Although the precession adjustments are stated to be with respect
*     to Lieske et al. (1977), the MHB2000 model does not specify which
*     set of Euler angles are to be used and how the adjustments are to
*     be applied.  The most literal and straightforward procedure is to
*     adopt the 4-rotation epsilon_0, psi_A, omega_A, xi_A option, and
*     to add DPSIPR to psi_A and DEPSPR to both omega_A and eps_A
*     (Wallace 2002).
*
*  4) This is an implementation of one aspect of the IAU 2000A nutation
*     model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2000,
*     namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002).

*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The epochs EP01+EP02 and EP11+EP12 are Julian Dates, apportioned
*     in any convenient way between the arguments EPn1 and EPn2.  For
*     example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these
*     ways, among others:
*
*             EPn1          EPn2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
*     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
*     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*     The two epochs may be expressed using different methods, but at
*     the risk of losing some resolution.
*
*  2) The accumulated precession angles zeta, z, theta are expressed
*     through canonical polynomials which are valid only for a limited
*     time span.  In addition, the IAU 1976 precession rate is known to
*     be imperfect.  The absolute accuracy of the present formulation is
*     better than 0.1 arcsec from 1960AD to 2040AD, better than 1 arcsec
*     from 1640AD to 2360AD, and remains below 3 arcsec for the whole of
*     the period 500BC to 3000AD.  The errors exceed 10 arcsec outside
*     the range 1200BC to 3900AD, exceed 100 arcsec outside 4200BC to
*     5600AD and exceed 1000 arcsec 1000 arcsec outside 6800BC to
*     8200AD.
*
*  3) The three angles are returned in the conventional order, which
*     is not the same as the order of the corresponding Euler rotations.
*     The precession matrix is R_3(-z) x R_2(+theta) x R_3(-zeta).

*                          -2 = null position vector
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The specified pv-vector is the coordinate direction (and its rate
*     of change) for the epoch at which the light leaving the star
*     reached the solar-system barycenter.
*
*  2) The star data returned by this routine are "observables" for an
*     imaginary observer at the solar-system barycenter.  Proper motion
*     and radial velocity are, strictly, in terms of barycentric
*     coordinate time, TCB.  For most practical applications, it is
*     permissible to neglect the distinction between TCB and ordinary
*     "proper" time on Earth (TT/TAI).  The result will, as a rule, be
*     limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the proper-motion and radial-
*     velocity data;  moreover, the supplied pv-vector is likely to be
*     merely an intermediate result (for example generated by the
*     routine iau_STARPV), so that a change of time unit will cancel
*     out overall.
*
*     In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
*     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
*     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
*     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
*
*     Summarizing, the specified pv-vector is for most stars almost
*     identical to the result of applying the standard geometrical
*     "space motion" transformation to the catalog data.  The
*     differences, which are the subject of the Stumpff paper cited
*     below, are:
*
*     (i) In stars with significant radial velocity and proper motion,
*     the constantly changing light-time distorts the apparent proper
*     motion.  Note that this is a classical, not a relativistic,
*     effect.
*
*     (ii) The transformation complies with special relativity.
*
*  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
*     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
*     parallax is in arcseconds; the radial velocity is in km/s, but
*     the pv-vector result is in AU and AU/day.
*
*  4) The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
*     and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per Julian
*     year.  The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not
*     true angle, and will thus be numerically larger at high
*     declinations.
*
*  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed in the inertial frame is
*     assumed.  If the speed is greater than or equal to the speed of
*     light, the routine aborts with an error status.
*
*  6) The inverse transformation is performed by the routine iau_STARPV.

*
*  The CIO locator s, positioning the Celestial Intermediate Origin on
*  the equator of the Celestial Intermediate Pole, given the CIP's X,Y
*  coordinates.  Compatible with IAU 2000A precession-nutation.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  canonical model.
*
*  Given:
*     DATE1,DATE2    d      TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
*     X,Y            d      CIP coordinates (Note 3)
*
*  Returned:
*     iau_S00        d      the CIO locator s in radians (Note 2)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The CIO locator s is the difference between the right ascensions
*     of the same point in two systems:  the two systems are the GCRS
*     and the CIP,CIO, and the point is the ascending node of the
*     CIP equator.  The quantity s remains below 0.1 arcsecond
*     throughout 1900-2100.
*
*  3) The series used to compute s is in fact for s+XY/2, where X and Y
*     are the x and y components of the CIP unit vector;  this series is
*     more compact than a direct series for s would be.  This routine
*     requires X,Y to be supplied by the caller, who is responsible for
*     providing values that are consistent with the supplied date.
*
*  4) The model is consistent with the IAU 2000A precession-nutation.

      DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION iau_S00A ( DATE1, DATE2 )
*+

*   i a u _ S 0 0 A
*  - - - - - - - - -
*
*  The CIO locator s, positioning the Celestial Intermediate Origin on
*  the equator of the Celestial Intermediate Pole, using the IAU 2000A
*  precession-nutation model.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     DATE1,DATE2    d      TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     iau_S00A       d      the CIO locator s in radians (Note 2)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The CIO locator s is the difference between the right ascensions
*     of the same point in two systems.  The two systems are the GCRS
*     and the CIP,CIO, and the point is the ascending node of the
*     CIP equator.  The CIO locator s remains a small fraction of
*     1 arcsecond throughout 1900-2100.
*
*  3) The series used to compute s is in fact for s+XY/2, where X and Y
*     are the x and y components of the CIP unit vector;  this series is

*
*  The CIO locator s, positioning the Celestial Intermediate Origin on
*  the equator of the Celestial Intermediate Pole, using the IAU 2000B
*  precession-nutation model.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     DATE1,DATE2    d      TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     iau_S00B       d      the CIO locator s in radians (Note 2)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The CIO locator s is the difference between the right ascensions
*     of the same point in two systems.  The two systems are the GCRS
*     and the CIP,CIO, and the point is the ascending node of the
*     CIP equator.  The CIO locator s remains a small fraction of
*     1 arcsecond throughout 1900-2100.
*
*  3) The series used to compute s is in fact for s+XY/2, where X and Y
*     are the x and y components of the CIP unit vector;  this series is
*     more compact than a direct series for s would be.  The present
*     routine uses the IAU 2000B truncated nutation model when
*     predicting the CIP position.  The routine iau_S00A uses instead
*     the full IAU 2000A model, but with no significant increase in
*     accuracy and at some cost in speed.

      DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION iau_S06A ( DATE1, DATE2 )
*+
*  - - - - - - - - -
*   i a u _ S 0 6 A
*  - - - - - - - - -
*
*  The CIO locator s, positioning the Celestial Intermediate Origin on
*  the equator of the Celestial Intermediate Pole, using the IAU 2006
*  precession and IAU 2000A nutation models.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     DATE1,DATE2    d      TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     iau_S06A       d      the CIO locator s in radians (Note 2)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The CIO locator s is the difference between the right ascensions
*     of the same point in two systems.  The two systems are the GCRS
*     and the CIP,CIO, and the point is the ascending node of the
*     CIP equator.  The CIO locator s remains a small fraction of
*     1 arcsecond throughout 1900-2100.
*
*  3) The series used to compute s is in fact for s+XY/2, where X and Y
*     are the x and y components of the CIP unit vector;  this series is
*     more compact than a direct series for s would be.  The present
*     routine uses the full IAU 2000A nutation model when predicting the
*     CIP position.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_PNM06A   classical NPB matrix, IAU 2006/2000A
*     iau_BPN2XY   extract CIP X,Y coordinates from NPB matrix
*     iau_S06      the CIO locator s, given X,Y, IAU 2006

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

*
*            DATE1          DATE2

*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in

*
*  2) The TIO locator s' is obtained from polar motion observations by
*     numerical integration, and so is in essence unpredictable.
*     However, it is dominated by a secular drift of about
*     47 microarcseconds per century, which is the approximation
*     evaluated by the present routine.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The starting and ending TDB epochs EP1A+EP1B and EP2A+EP2B are
*     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the two
*     parts (A and B).  For example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be
*     expressed in any of these ways, among others:
*
*             EPnA          EPnB
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
*     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
*     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
*     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
*
*     The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
*     and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per TDB
*     Julian year.
*
*     The parallax and radial velocity are in the same frame.
*
*  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
*     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
*     parallax is in arcseconds.
*
*  4) The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true
*     angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper
*     motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec)
*     before use.
*
*  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame,
*     is assumed.
*
*  6) An extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is interpreted
*     to mean that the object is on the "celestial sphere", the radius
*     of which is an arbitrary (large) value (see the iau_STARPV routine
*     for the value used).  When the distance is overridden in this way,
*     the status, initially zero, has 1 added to it.
*
*  7) If the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the
*     constant VMAX in the routine iau_STARPV), it is arbitrarily set to
*     zero.  When this action occurs, 2 is added to the status.
*
*  8) The relativistic adjustment carried out in the iau_STARPV routine
*     involves an iterative calculation.  If the process fails to
*     converge within a set number of iterations, 4 is added to the
*     status.

*                        else = binary logical OR of the above
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The star data accepted by this routine are "observables" for an
*     imaginary observer at the solar-system barycenter.  Proper motion
*     and radial velocity are, strictly, in terms of barycentric
*     coordinate time, TCB.  For most practical applications, it is
*     permissible to neglect the distinction between TCB and ordinary
*     "proper" time on Earth (TT/TAI).  The result will, as a rule, be
*     limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the proper-motion and radial-
*     velocity data;  moreover, the pv-vector is likely to be merely an
*     intermediate result, so that a change of time unit would cancel
*     out overall.
*
*     In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
*     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
*     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
*     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
*
*  2) The resulting position and velocity pv-vector is with respect to
*     the same frame and, like the catalog coordinates, is freed from
*     the effects of secular aberration.  Should the "coordinate
*     direction", where the object was located at the catalog epoch, be
*     required, it may be obtained by calculating the magnitude of the
*     position vector PV(1-3,1) dividing by the speed of light in AU/day
*     to give the light-time, and then multiplying the space velocity
*     PV(1-3,2) by this light-time and adding the result to PV(1-3,1).
*
*     Summarizing, the pv-vector returned is for most stars almost
*     identical to the result of applying the standard geometrical
*     "space motion" transformation.  The differences, which are the
*     subject of the Stumpff paper referenced below, are:
*
*     (i) In stars with significant radial velocity and proper motion,
*     the constantly changing light-time distorts the apparent proper
*     motion.  Note that this is a classical, not a relativistic,
*     effect.
*
*     (ii) The transformation complies with special relativity.
*
*  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
*     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
*     parallax is in arcseconds; the radial velocity is in km/s, but
*     the pv-vector result is in AU and AU/day.
*
*  4) The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true
*     angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper
*     motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec)
*     before use.
*
*  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame,
*     is assumed.
*
*  6) An extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is interpreted
*     to mean that the object is on the "celestial sphere", the radius
*     of which is an arbitrary (large) value (see the constant PXMIN).
*     When the distance is overridden in this way, the status, initially
*     zero, has 1 added to it.
*
*  7) If the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the
*     constant VMAX), it is arbitrarily set to zero.  When this action
*     occurs, 2 is added to the status.
*
*  8) The relativistic adjustment involves an iterative calculation.
*     If the process fails to converge within a set number (IMAX) of
*     iterations, 4 is added to the status.
*
*  9) The inverse transformation is performed by the routine iau_PVSTAR.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The Celestial Intermediate Pole coordinates are the x,y components
*     of the unit vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference System.
*
*  3) The CIO locator s (in radians) positions the Celestial
