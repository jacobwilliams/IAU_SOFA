*  Fundamental argument, IERS Conventions (2003):
*  general accumulated precession in longitude.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  canonical model.
*
*  Given:
*     T           d    TDB, Julian centuries since J2000 (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     iau_FAPA03  d    general precession in longitude, radians (Note 2)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) Though T is strictly TDB, it is usually more convenient to use TT,
*     which makes no significant difference.
*
*  2) The expression used is as adopted in IERS Conventions (2003).  It
*     is taken from Kinoshita & Souchay (1990) and comes originally from
*     Lieske et al. (1977).
