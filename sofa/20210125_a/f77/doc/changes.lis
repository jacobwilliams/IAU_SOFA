Summary of Changes
------------------
The changes fall into the following categories:

(1) Extra defensive precautions when computing atmospheric refraction
    at low altitudes.

(2) Application of polar motion handling changed to rigorous. 
    These improvements may result in differences which will be less
    than 1 mu arcsecond (0.000 001 arc seconds).

(3) Expanded documentation, including a new cookbook for the SOFA
    Vector Matrix Library.

(4) Typographical and other minor corrections.

(5) Changes to the test program.

(1) iau_ATIOQ    Include a limit in altitude (about 3 degrees) below
                 which atmospheric refraction is held constant, for
                 defense and to make it consistent with iau_atoiq.

Summary of Change
-----------------

The change for this minor release (17a) relates to dealing with leap 
seconds during the period 1960 and 1971.

Between the introduction of UTC at the start of 1960 and the first
leap second at the end of 1971 there were a series of small offsets
and rate changes with respect to TAI.  The SOFA routine D2DTF takes
these into account, but a shortcoming in the algorithm meant that
under certain conditions a leap second could be flagged even though
none had occurred.  

Such cases were extremely rare, and moreover depended to some extent 
on compiler behaviour, affecting rounding.

SOFA is grateful to the Astropy group for reporting an instance of
this bug, which has been corrected.

FORTRAN Routine
----------------

iau_d2dtf      Format for output a 2-part Julian Date (or in the case 
               of UTC a quasi-JD form that includes special provision 
               for leap seconds).
