                  -------------------------------
                  THE IAU-SOFA SOFTWARE LIBRARIES
                  -------------------------------


    SOFA stands for "Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy".  The SOFA
    software libraries are a collection of subprograms, in source-
    code form, which implement official IAU algorithms for fundamental-
    astronomy computations.   The subprograms at present comprise 69
    "astronomy" routines supported by 52 "vector/matrix" routines, all
    written in Fortran.  In the future the number of astronomy routines
    will increase, and implementations in other languages will be
    introduced.


THE SOFA INITIATIVE

The IAU set up the SOFA initiative at the 1994 General Assembly, to
promulgate an authoritative set of fundamental-astronomy constants and
algorithms.  At the subsequent General Assembly, in 1997, the appointment
of a SOFA Review Board and the selection of a site for the SOFA Center
(the outlet for SOFA products) were announced.

The SOFA initiative was originally proposed by the IAU Working Group on
Astronomical Standards (WGAS), under the chairmanship of Toshio Fukushima.
The proposal was for "...new arrangements to establish and maintain an
accessible and authoritative set of constants, algorithms and procedures
that implement standard models used in fundamental astronomy".  The SOFA
Software Libraries implement the "algorithms" part of the SOFA initiative.
They were developed under the supervision of an international panel
called the SOFA Review Board.  The current membership of this panel is
listed in an appendix.

The SOFA Review Board is now part of Task 5 (Computation Tools) of the IAU
Working Group on the International Celestial Reference System (WGICRS),
which is part of Division 1 (Fundamental Astronomy).  The same person
chairs both the SOFA Review Board and WGICRS Task 5.

A feature of the original SOFA software proposals was that the products
would be self-contained and not depend on other software.  This includes
basic documentation, which, like the present file, will be plain ASCII
text.  It should also be noted that there is no assumption that the
software will be used on a particular computer and Operating System.
Although OS-related facilities may be present (Unix make files for
instance, use by the SOFA Center of automatic code management systems,
HTML versions of some documentation), the routines themselves will be
visible as individual text files and will run on a variety of platforms.


ALGORITHMS

The SOFA Review Board's initial goal has been to create a set of callable
subprograms.  Whether "subroutines" or "functions", they are all referred
to simply as "routines".  They are designed for use by software developers
wishing to write complete applications;  no runnable, free-standing
applications are included in SOFA's present plans.

The algorithms are drawn from a variety of sources.  Because most of the
routines so far developed have either been standard "text-book" operations
or implement well-documented standard algorithms, it has not been
necessary to invite the whole community to submit algorithms, though
consultation with authorities has occurred where necessary.  It should
also be noted that consistency with the conventions published by the
International Earth Rotation Service was a stipulation in the original
SOFA proposals, further constraining the software designs. This state of
affairs will continue to exist for some time, as there is a large backlog
of agreed extensions to work on.  However, in the future the Board may
decide to call for proposals, and is in the meantime willing to look into
any suggestions that are received by the SOFA Center.


SCOPE

The routines currently available are listed in the next two chapters of
this document.

The "astronomy" library comprises 69 routines.  Coverage is limited in
this early release, but the areas addressed include calendars, timescales,
ephemerides, precession/nutation, star space-motion, and star catalog
conversions.

The "vector-matrix" library, comprising 52 routines, contains a collection
of simple tools for manipulating the vectors, matrices and angles used by
the astronomy routines.  Although this library can be used in its own
right, it is limited in scope to what the other SOFA routines require.
Some users may be better served by the many specialist libraries available
elsewhere.

There is no explicit commitment by SOFA to support historical models,
though as time goes on a legacy of superseded models will naturally
accumulate.  There is, for example, no support of B1950/FK4 star
coordinates, or pre-1976 precession models, though these capabilities
will be added if there is a demand.

Though the SOFA software libraries are rather limited in scope, and are
likely to remain so for a considerable time, they do offer distinct
advantages to prospective users.  In particular, the routines are:

  * authoritative:  they are IAU-backed and have been constructed with
    great care;

  * practical:  they are straightforward to use in spite of being
    precise and rigorous (to some stated degree);

  * accessible and supported: they are downloadable from an easy-to-
    find place, they are in an integrated and consistent form, they
    come with adequate internal documentation, and help for users is
    available.


VERSIONS

Once it has been published, an issue will not be revised or updated and
will remain accessible indefinitely.  Subsequent issues may, however,
include corrected versions under the original filename and routine name.
However, where a different model is introduced, it will have a different
name.

The issues will be referred to by the date when they were announced.  The
frequency of re-issue will be decided by the Board, taking into account
the importance of the changes and the impact on the user community.


DOCUMENTATION

At present there is little or no free-standing documentation about
individual routines.  However, each routine has preamble comments which
specify in detail what the routine does and how it is used.


PROGRAMMING STANDARDS

The first release is in Fortran 77 only.  Work on C equivalents is about
to start, and related software in other languages is being considered.

The Fortran code conforms to ANSI X3.9-1978 in all but two minor respects:
each has an IMPLICIT NONE declaration, and its name has a prefix of "iau_"
and may be longer than 6 characters.  A global edit to erase both of these
will produce ANSI-compliant code with no change in its function.

Fortran coding style, and restrictions on the range of language features,
have been much debated by the Board, and the results comply with the
majority view.  There is (at present) no document that sets out the
standard, but the code itself offers a wide range of examples of what is
acceptable.

The routines contain explicit numerical constants (the INCLUDE statement
is not part of ANSI Fortran 77).  These are drawn from the file consts.lis,
which is listed in an appendix.


COPYRIGHT ISSUES

Copyright for all of the SOFA software and documentation is owned by the
IAU SOFA Review Board.  The Software is made available free of charge for
use by private individuals for non-profit research and by non-profit
educational, academic and research institutions.  Potential commercial
users of the Software should contact the Board.

Further details are included in the block of comments which concludes
every routine.  This block of comments is also given as an appendix to
the present document.


ACCURACY

The SOFA policy is to organize the calculations so that the machine
accuracy is fully exploited.  The gap between the precision of the
underlying model or theory and the computational resolution has to
be kept as large as possible, hopefully leaving several orders
of magnitude of headroom.

The SOFA routines in some cases involve design compromises between
rigor and ease of use (and also speed, though nowadays this is
seldom a major concern).


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The Board is indebted to a number of contributors, who are acknowledged in
the preamble comments of the routines concerned.

Board are provided by the UK's Particle Physics and Astronomy Research
Council through its various astronomy programs at the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory.
