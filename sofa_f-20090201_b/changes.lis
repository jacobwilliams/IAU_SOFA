Revisions (released 2009 March 18)

1) A bug affecting the routines iau_FK52H and iau_H2FK5 has been corrected. 
   This caused erroneous proper motions (and also radial velocity) to be 
   returned.

2) The testbed t_sofa_f.for have been updated to reflect the changes to 
   iau_FK52H and iau_H2FK5.


Revisions (released 2009 April 02)

1) An error in the description of the coordinates of the Celestial Intermediate
   Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial Reference System in the 
   routines iau_C2T00A, iau_C2T00B, iau_C2T06A, iau_C2TPE, iau_C2TXY and 
   iau_POM00 has been corrected. These revisions have no effect on the results 
   produced by these routines.
